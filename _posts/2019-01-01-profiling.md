In this paper, we proposed a novel framework composed of four key components of speech motor control (i.e., coordination, consistency, speed, and precision) to characterize speech impairments in persons with ALS. Our findings revealed impairments across all components except consistency. We also found that consistency, speed, and precision were correlated with speech severity in the ALS group as indexed by SMR. Additional research is required to determine whether these four components of speech motor control correlate with functional measures of speech such as intelligibility. Further research is also needed to test this framework with other types of dysarthria that are likely to be characterized by different patterns of impairments. The results of such studies will inform impairment-specific ASR models and determine the use of this framework as an effective assessment tool.
