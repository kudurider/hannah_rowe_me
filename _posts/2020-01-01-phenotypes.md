Taken together, the findings suggest that our framework has potential as a valid diagnostic tool with which we can discriminate speech motor disorders based on their underlying articulatory impairments. These phenotypes—derived from interpretable, hypothesis-driven features—can inform classification algorithms for differential diagnosis and guide impairment-based feature selection for ASR models, ultimately increasing clinical confidence in assessing and treating speech motor disorders. Further research is needed to validate our acoustic features against corresponding biomechanical features.
