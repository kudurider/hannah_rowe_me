Overall, our findings revealed a strong focus in the speech motor literature on acoustic features that represent precision and an underrepresentation of studies on features that represent coordination, consistency, speed, and repetition rate. In light of the need for research across all articulatory components to elucidate articulatory phenotypes, the restricted focus on precision is problematic. Furthermore, while the limited data in our meta-analysis precluded us from making specific recommendations regarding the most promising feature for each population, our results revealed phenotypic variability in articulatory impairments across speech motor subtypes. This finding motivates the need to employ more impairment-specific knowledge in algorithm development, which may significantly extend the impact such models have for individuals with NMDs. However, there remains a significant need to broaden and deepen our understanding of the articulatory phenotypes underlying NMDs.
