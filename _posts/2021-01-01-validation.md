The results of this study demonstrate that our acoustically driven framework has potential as an objective, valid, and clinically useful tool for profiling articulatory deficits in individuals with speech motor disorders. Our findings also suggest that compared to clinician ratings, instrumental measures may be more sensitive to subtle differences in articulatory function. With further research, this framework could provide accurate and reliable characterizations of articulatory impairment, which may eventually increase the efficacy of diagnosis and treatment for patients with different articulatory phenotypes.
