Improving ASR accuracy for dysarthric speech may have significant implications for communication and quality of life. This article outlined the sources of diversity inherent to speech motor disorders, their potential impact on ASR performance, and the importance of their representation in training sets. Representing dysarthric speech variability in ASR corpora may be an important step for improving disordered speech ASR and is consistent with the call to action in the artificial intelligence community to reduce bias in the training data by increasing diversity.
