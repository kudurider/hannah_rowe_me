This study sought to assess the articulatory phenotypes of four neurodegenerative populations known to have divergent speech motor deficits and determine the efficacy of articulatory phenotyping for classifying different diseases. We aimed to address a primary limitation of the current differential diagnosis literature by expanding the range of neurological/pathophysiological deficits and articulatory characteristics examined in one study. We found evidence of distinct articulatory phenotypes for the four clinical groups (i.e., ALS, PA, PD, and nfPPA + PAOS), which highlights the phenotypic variability present across neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the phenotypes demonstrated strong classification accuracy for characterizing neurodegenerative diseases, which emphasizes the potential clinical utility of using a comprehensive profile of articulation.
