Hello! I am a speech scientist and certified speech-language pathologist interested in speech motor control in neurologically impaired populations. I completed my PhD in Rehabilitation Sciences at the MGH Institute of Health Professions (advisor: Dr. Jordan Green) and am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in speech neuroscience at Boston University (advisor: Dr. Frank Guenther).

My research centers around using acoustics, kinematics, neuroimaging, neurostimulation, and computational modeling to (1) comprehensively characterize the heterogeneity within and across speech motor populations and (2) identify neural and physiological correlates of speech motor control. The overarching goal of my research program is to improve the current state of diagnosis and treatment of speech motor disorders, with a particular focus on adults who stutter and individuals with neurodegenerative diseases.

I live with my husband and our dog (/child) in Boston, and my life interests include playing music and running, hiking, and skiing in beautiful places.
